This is a school project, where I practise coding Python. 
The amount of done tasks will increase when the course proceeds.

The files are in directories named after modules or content and files named after the task and module it was in. 
So there is Module_n_task_n. (Moduuli_2_teht_1) etc.

The task are my jurney through my studies, Ohjelmisto 1., Python 1., 
from Metropolia, Bachelor of Engineering, Information Technology.

Feel free to read my work and follow the progress I'm making.
